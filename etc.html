                A bunch of iterator implementations in various languages to try out programming styles

                (I'm not going to pretend any of this is worthy.)
                But, yes, I wrote fanfics. Quickly, since I didn't
                bother editing thoroughly (or at all, really). I suppose I should own up
                to it... <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5970139/hugoGrant">here</a> and a few <a href="https://www.fictionpress.com/u/1025394/">here</a>.

            <div class="place-description">
                I collect maps! Most are from family + friend's travels,
                so I haven't actually visited a bunch of the cool places
                mapped. Also, alas, I don't own all of these - some are just
                nice ones I found lying around in stores.

                I try to play Go, but rarely have the time.
                Here I mean the boardgame. I'd refer to the programming language
                if it had generics. <a href="https://online-go.com/player/165969/">Feel free to challenge me!</a>
