> I'm a fool. I couldn't let myself to go... even though I feel... the end.

More seriously, here's all the branches:

| Branch | What? |
|---|---|
| `fandom-blogs` | Writing about TV. Particularly the crown. |
| `nihon-ongaku` | To make JPop song translations. |
| `radix-sort` | Some writings on the radix sort algorithm. I haven't actually finished this... over 3 years? I think? |
| `pl-taxonomy` | A prolog program to catalogue features of programming languages that I notice. |
| `heckru-writing` | A blog on the HackRU RnD team. I lost steam, so this is probably just dead. |
