## Branches

> I'm a fool. I couldn't let myself to go... even though I feel... the end.

More seriously, here's all the branches I care about:

| Branch | What? |
|---|---|
| `fandom-blogs` | Writing about TV. Particularly the crown. |
| `radix-sort` | Some writings on the radix sort algorithm. I haven't actually finished this... over 3 years? I think? |
| `pl-taxonomy` | A prolog program to catalogue features of programming languages that I notice. |
| `heckru-writing` | A blog on the HackRU RnD team. I lost steam, so this is probably just dead. |
| `self-writing` | This is some attempt at automatically reading my github or something. IDK. |

I'm vaguely following feature branches, but I forget features or loose interest in them, but don't want to let them go.
