                I want to write this more like prose because it's a story. And it'll be in first person
                because it's mine. Hopefully, I'll figure out a way to navigate the weeds: there are some
                issues with talking about people's personal details, so I'll just anonymise in the worst
                case scenario.

                This is mostly about the mistakes I made in college. There's definitely some good stuff.

                <a href="../etc.html#hazukashi" alt="hazukashi">other things I linked.</a>
                So the tone will waver and likely suck. And there'll be paragraphs about the room I happened to
                be in. Hopefully I'll edit this -- may the git log be ever in my favor.

                Data structures was, initially, scary. I heard of BSTs from a friend, and I knew linked lists
                from random programming things I'd look up. But what about assignments? Coding? The tests? I
                had no idea how to even sit through a lecture. If only I could go back and try again: I'd know
                so much more.
            </div>
            <div class="padded-text">
                The first lecture, however, included a part I could barely hear: somebody came in and talked about
                a CS club. I had heard of the CS club at this point -- USACS. I knew that they were the group of
                people who apparently talked about the things I liked: functional programming, linux, and just
                programming. It sounded like they were the right people. But I couldn't hear anything that was
                being said except for something like "code red," "for new students," and finally, "Friday at 1pm,
                Hill 252, the CAVE."

            <div class="padded-text">
                I don't remember the exact mistake I made: whether I got there at exactly 1pm or 20 minutes before.
                I know that I waited a few weeks, pretty much out of nervousness. Now that I try to remember the
                corridor as an unfamiliar place, I find it difficult. The day had to be cloudy: the corridor was
                dark as it tends to be when the sun doesn't make it through the tall windows and the lights above
                aren't on.
