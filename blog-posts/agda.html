	      I think it's important by lower the expectations. You know that small space where there's no
	      higher homotopies? Smaller means we're just propositions? Yeah? Smaller: that empty type.
	      Now that I've truncated your expectations, know that if you have any expectations, through
	      induction on the empty type, I will construct some random nonsense.

	      Agda has features that make writing it weird, especially if you're used to Haskell.
	    </div>
            <div class="padded-text">
	      Firstly, in Haskell, it is common to format code like so "<code>A: </code>" but this doesn't
	      parse as you'd expect in Agda: you need "<code>A : </code>". I have no idea why, but I think
	      the upshot is that <code>A:</code> is a valid name in Agda and isn't <code>A</code>.
            </div>
            <div class="padded-text">
	      The second issue I hit was that underscores are different. Agda tries to be nice and Lispy,
	      letting the coder define functions as "mixfix operators" where underscores are blanks.
	      So <code>if_then_else_ : Bool -&gt; A -&gt; A</code> (I'll not make it compile, sorry),
	      is a sort of "ternary operator" as you'd expect conditionals to work in other languages.
	      I dislike this: it makes programmers able to mess up the order of operations. Also,
	      I_like_underscores_in_variables more-than-dashes when there are infix operators (since infix <code>-</code>)
	      gets confusing otherwise. May be Agda doesn't face this since it doesn't actually come with
	      integers or any internal representations of numbers (ie. <code>2</code> isn't a special token
	      to the compiler). But it's weird and I think it'd limit the usability of Agda if it wants to
	      reach beyond the playground for type theorists it currently is.
            </div>
            <div class="padded-text">
	      The third thing about symbols actually infuriated me. And, ostensibly, it looks like a feature.
	      Unicode. It's pretty. It's got blackboard-bold N, and real arrows. I mean, we can even bold our
	      1 to mean that one type and use bold 0 to mean my understanding of HoTT. What's not to love?
            </div>
            <div class="padded-text">
	      There's actually two answers to that. Firstly, did you know that there's a glyph for
	      <code>::</code> that's one character? Guess what, the standard library calls it cons.
	      Secondly, it's unicode: it's hard to input on a normal keyboard (hi APL, I see you).
	      It seems to need a special extension for any editor you use (and I switched to emacs for this).
	      As much as I like the emacs extension, this is a barrier to entry that I think isn't worth it
	      if the language ever cares about an audience that's not just type theorists. Honestly, it
	      also ruined my night with the <code>::</code> glyph.

            <div class="big-title">How not to Look for Documentation</div>
            <div class="padded-text">
	      I'm not 100% sure this is my fault. But this is a fault, so it's in my rant about Agda.
	      In particular, it's a terrible experience to look for documentation and as somebody barely
	      learning how to SWE properly, it just rubs salt in the wound. I'm going to pretend to be
	      organized a provide a list of grievances:
	      <ol>
		<li>Library docs can be research papers. And those papers can be hard to follow.</li>
		<li>The docs won't be consistent about wording. And your textbook will use a third lexicon.</li>
		<li>There are no simple examples for later concepts. (Like how to use the <code>Extensionality</code> in the stdlib? Seriously: why is the level not a hidden parameter?)</li>
		<li>The code is honestly hard to read without knowing what's going on. The use of unicode and mixfix worsens it by making it too short to understand.</li>
	      </ol>
	      I think it's fair to say it's just hard to understand. So at least it ought to be documented well.
	      And for God's sake: why does everybody have to have their own HoTT library, it's the same stuff.
	      (But that's also a gripe with theorem provers I generally have: why does the field insist on splintering its minute audience?)
            </div>
            <div class="padded-text">
	      Related: the compiler errors don't ever make sense. May be the expectation is to use the interactive
	      development mode, but I'm too used to just writing stuff out (that is what programmers do
	      most of the time afterall), and my habits lead to a lot of errors from the compiler.
	      In and of itself, this is OK. Compilers are supposed to beat me into submission with walls
	      of errors. I mean, I code in C++ for God's sake. But, even the template instantiation cesspool
	      leads me to an action that gets rid of the error. The Agda parse error has never been helpful,
	      and the compile errors seem to be talking to people who actually know how Agda works.
	      That is terrible design. I might try to fix this some day. Another feature request: can the compiler
	      have a table of look-alike glyphs so that it can suggest them when it can't find a symbol?
	      It would really help since the Unicode is otherwise impenetrable. I guess that's a personal action-item.
	      Rustc's error messages should be an aspiration for all compiler writers, I swear.
            </div>
            <div class="big-title">How not to Install Agda on Arch Linux</div>
            <div class="padded-text">
	      Haskell on Arch is a sad story. And Agda is a Haskell library. The whole cabal and stack way
	      of doing it might be better than hoping pacman doesn't need a full -Syu to get the next version
	      of Agda. That said, the pacman way is a bit messy with 2.6 since 2.6 tries to produce temporary
	      files in the directories it builds files in and there are dependencies inside /usr/share.
	      This means I currently have to <code>sudo agda</code> and then, if I want to, re-build it without sudo for
	      the emacs plugin to understand it. This is totally my fault. Just don't be me. Symlink the
	      stdlib in your own home directory or something.
            </div>
            <div class="padded-text">
	      That's it. That's my rant. So far. &#8718;
