                    東京へ転職できました！And living my dream has taught me some stuff, and hopefully, will continue to teach me.
                    One thing I started to get into was urban planning. Leaving the US is generally a breath of fresh air in terms
                    of understanding what urban planning could be. And 2023 has had a lot of that, given that the latter half will
                    be in Tokyo. So here I want to summarize some thoughts: not all "things the US does poorly," too -- there's
                    definitely some "huh, I think the US does this better?" (Or, "woah, Tokyo does this weirdly.")

                    It's vaguely ordered by: walking, taking the train, the roads, then the built environment. But some topics overlap.

                <div class="padded-text">
                    This is also very Tokyo-centric: I've heard that other cities are very different and I can't comment on them in much
                    detail.

                <div class="padded-text">
                    This actually began to form in my head in India. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaveri_Bazaar">Zaveri Bazaar</a>,
                    we had to weave around four layers of parked motorbikes to get from the narrow street to the storefront.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Cementing this in further, was the fact that the one bike lane by the Google office in Pittsburgh had a signal for a pedestrian
                    crossing.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Finally, I biked in Tokyo. I used <a href="https://docomo-cycle.jp/">自転車シェアリング</a> to grab a bike from Tsukishima down
                    to Tatsumi, for a 165 yen, 22 min ride.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    On the shared bike, I realized that I was pretty much functioning how I do when driving. The way I look at things, try to predict
                    distant people's movements.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    And then I had to park it at Tatsumi station, with 100 other shared bikes.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Tokyo, I think, is close to doing bikes right.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Well, it's not perfect, but I actually think Amsterdam is too much, and the US is too little. Tokyo has wide enough side walks and
                    safe side-streets, and this is a much more useful goal I think than simply trying to emulate the Netherlands.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Not to mention: bikes are better than cars, but they're still mostly individual transit and don't scale the way public transit does.
                    They still need parking -- you're likely going to see a high percent of time where the bike is parked, much like you do with cars.
                    Futhermore, bikes are also dangerous. Yes, worst case fractures are significantly better than worst case dying, but it's still not as
                    good as walking.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    In Japan, it seems that you can buy bike insurance, much like you buy car insurance. Additionally, Japan discourages bike and car
                    commuting, preferring public transit (I'm not a legal expert -- I've just heard that there are some rules here that can be complicated).
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    My perspective might be biased since a lot of urban planning YouTube does rant about bike infrastructure. This makes sense if the creator
                    or intended audience are primarily in North America, as I think bike infrastructure will be a significant improvement there, but in Europe and
                    Asia, I wonder if attention is best paid elsewhere.

                <div class="big-title">Alarm fatigue: or the number of times one can hear ご注意してください and actually 注意して.</div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_(Huxley_novel)">Aldous Huxley's "Island"</a>, the Myna birds are trained to say "Attention,"
                    to foster attentiveness and awareness of the present.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    In Tokyo, every driveway and truck, most escalators, and some cross roads also have voices asking to ご注意ください.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    While to some I'm sure there's an element of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alarm_fatigue">alarm fatigue</a>, I think this has
                    some urban planning benefits. For one, if you know when to expect the alarm, it's not tiring at all: it's actually somewhat pleasant to
                    hear the thing you expect to. Additionally, and more importantly, I think this shows how much concern for safety is actually there.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    The nicest example of this is probably the people working at certain crossings -- parking lot entryways, or for school children. We should
                    have more of these everywhere. I particularly like that driveways for supermarket parking lots have these.

                <div class="padded-text">
                    In the US you walk on the right. Similarly in the UK, you walk on the left. I think the only counter-examples I know are when there's just
                    a mass of people going the same way. So you'd think that Japan would be nice and orderly and you'd walk on the left everywhere. でじょう？
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Nope.

                <div class="padded-text">
                    What you actually need to do is read the signs. If there aren't signs? Read the air.

                <div class="padded-text">
                    While I don't expect this to actually be fixed on the average sidewalk, I always wonder what the logic is when this happens within a station.
                    (I think 銀座一丁目駅 insists that you stay on the left on after the ticket barrier but exit 8 wants you on the right and I'm decently sure
                    豊洲 is also inconsistent.)
                </div>

            <div id="slide-4">
                <div class="big-title">Jay-walking. 横断禁止?</div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Japan is very anti-jaywalking. You have fences blocking you next to most of the (st)roads, and even some of the streets.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    However, there are two points that stick out to me: firstly, the narrower streets don't even have sidewalks, and secondly, despite the
                    fences, you can hear annoucements reminding you not to jaywalk.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Usually, I'm actually pro-jaywalking (or, I guess, against the <a href="https://youtu.be/lrfsTNNCbP0?si=GdZWEzVPcZcolIF0">term coined by car-companies</a>).
                    But I feel like Japan has a mix of good and bad. The fences add safety. The curbs and aforementioned crossing guards make cars feel like guests on side-walk
                    cutting driveways. The distances between crossings aren't bad. The narrow streets are really good built environments.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Just: why do I have to either detour, go upwards, or remember to
                    <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/hoEAS5Mt6TNQyFS87">cross 250m earlier</a> if I want to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/tNRP3nP7smZSsSjw8">cross to get to Aeon in Shinonome from Toyosu</a>?
                    Sometimes the infrastructure misses a point.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Not to mention that <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/KpAF9ojwiQFFhDFP8">this intersection in Shiohama</a> is very awkward at best: from the north-west, going clockwise, we have: just stairs
                    (north west corner), a long ramp for a bikes and pedestrians, a stair case with a ramp for bikers to push their bike up, and another elongated bike and pedestrian ramp. It's really weird that
                    the north-west corner is completely lacking in bike support. Also, there's no real reason you'd want to cross Mitsume dori as the elongated ramps insist you might: I think there might be just
                    as many trips where you'd have to cross mitsume dori again. Not to mention that if you just want to cross <span title="'Third ring road?' Not sure what that name is.">環状３号線</span> you might
                    be better of biking down the block, using the zebra crossing, and biking back up. It's a 100m detour and you don't have the cardio of climbing a ramp or carrying your bike up or down some stairs.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    So yeah, some good ideas with Jaywalking: the fences are safe, and I think the principles are sound. But some places just... drop the ball.

                <div class="big-title">Should maps be oriented for the viewer?</div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    This is really minor but something that boggled my mind. The maps in Tokyo are oriented for the viewer, not based on the compass.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    IDK. I guess that's all I had to say. I'm fascinated that this was even a point worth noticing, and it's a good reflection on familiarity and hidden assumptions. Also, the maps here are otherwise
                    brilliant. I also like the half-table half-map diagrams places have that explain how you should get to a place
                    (<a href="https://izumooyashiro.or.jp/access#:~:text=%E4%B8%80%E7%95%91%E3%83%90%E3%82%B9%E6%99%82%E5%88%BB%E8%A1%A8-,%E9%9B%BB%E8%BB%8A%E3%81%A7%E3%81%8A%E8%B6%8A%E3%81%97%E3%81%AE%E5%A0%B4%E5%90%88,-%E6%9D%B1%E4%BA%AC%E6%96%B9%E9%9D%A2%E3%81%8B%E3%82%89">example</a>).

                <div class="padded-text">
                    I don't actually know which approach is better. I guess they have interesting trade-offs.

                <div class="big-title">Massive stations for fun and profit!</div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Japanese stations can be massive and absurdly well-connected. (May be there is <a href="https://youtu.be/EhV500dnQ00?si=29DBYMOhadN5CQBD" alt="Or well, fun economics and history.">a profit incentive</a>.)
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Of course, there are the famous stations: Shinjuku has probably the same throughput as various other metro systems, Tokyo station is better described as a mall (and a conglomerate of at least five stations, really),
                    and those are just the two biggest ones.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    But the more fascinating point is not the massive "hauptbanhopf" or whatever -- a lot of places have really good massive main stations.
                    The more interesting stations are the medium sized stations: for example, 豊洲 station has some really neat connections: it reaches
                    from Lalaport through to the mall at Ciel Toyosu. It's really nice. And there's similar connectivity underground -- if not slightly more.
                    月島 is similarly nicely medium-sized, as is 住吉. It's convenient. And it's really nice that buildings have many ways to be reached.
                    It's also really fun for exploring and getting places.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    But you also get lost.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    市ヶ谷 has sent me for a loop -- it has a transfer-only exit that I only understood after... exiting. (You exit the metro and enter JR.)
                    That was frustrating. 飯田橋 is also kind of a maze. 日本橋 also has a confusing staircase that runs past a 銀座線 platform. But the
                    worst is probably 永田町 or 赤坂見附駅 -- here's <a href="https://youtu.be/_yfRF4Fc-l4?si=UL2QPWdAsN-M7_ty">a whole video about it</a>.
                    Seriously. That thing on the 半蔵門線 is the wrong kind of cross-platform transfer (though the one at 赤坂見附 is good). 門前仲駅 is also
                    not fully connected -- exit 1 and 2 are inacessible from the お江戸 line (but the fare gates don't charge you if you go the other way which
                    is some odd magic), and the staircases up to the 東西線 force you to choose the direction at the bottom.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    And then JR comes in with cross-platform transfers and rail arrangements that change to keep allowing more of those. If you look at the

                <div class="padded-text">
                    Train chimes are somewhat famous in Japan. In fact, there is commentary on all the sounds of the train station. (That is the
                    deliberate artificial ones, not the accidental shrieks of trains.)
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    One thing that is worth adding to the discussion is a minor observation on smaller stations: the voices are separated by gender.
                    A female voice announces everything about one direction (usually bilingually in Tokyo), and a male voice announces the other.
                    This is very useful for when they end up speaking in tandem -- you sort of realize which gender you need to follow. (Of course
                    there's something to be said about the fact that gender is the axis JR and Tokyo Metro chose, but it works.)
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    A second thing that I have not fully understood is the sheer variety of the chimes. In particular, the train company seems to chose
                    the chime per station. This means that, for one, Tatsumi has a small variety of chimes thanks to Tokyo Metro, Seibu, and Tobu. But
                    also Toei has the lamest chime and it's the same per station.

                <div class="padded-text">
                    It is rather shocking how many stroads Tokyo has. The 6-lane behemoths that tear a broad grid across Koto-ku are the closest to
                    me. Many of these are quite obviously stroads: they connect lengths of the city while having businesses and side-streets draining
                    into them everywhere.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    However, to pretend that all stroads are the same cancer on the built environment feels strange. Or even to really look at all stroads as
                    equals. After all, if a stroad is in the middle of a city, does it really serve the same purpose? I think there's a slight distinction,
                    perhaps one that we could reason about.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    From the driver's perspective, which I can only take in the US, I wouldn't think of fifth Avenue as a stroad, though it probably is. There's
                    too much entropy on the large street for me to really think that I can go fast.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Furthermore, as a pedestrian, I am not unwelcome -- I could be more welcomed onto those six luxurious lanes -- but I feel like I have space
                    (mostly) and that the cars are not particularly dangerous.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    To explain this urban stroad, I think I want to <span title="perhaps define, but hopefully not 're-define'">co-opt</span> the word "boulevard."
                    I think the urban stroad is actually what the boulevard was supposed to be when the French drew these wider tree-lined carriageways across Paris.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    In Tokyo, the boulevards that come to mind are Chuo-dori in Akihabara and Ometesando. Eitai-dori and Shin-Ohashi-dori are stroads (in places).
                    I think the distinction is important. It classifies the overall use of the street (and later on road).
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Now that I live in a city large enough for such mixes of usage and expectation, I'm realizing that the worst of stroads really is in the subarbs.
                    They aren't good for cities, I'm sure, but their downsides are mitigated by density.

                    The one thing I find particularly odd is why these special right turning stop lines aren't a thing outside Japan. <a href="https://youtu.be/KTKtsUSo2pA?si=IfdRENHRRVLdUoqV">See this video for examples.</a>
                    You'll notice that on large enough intersections, there are places where, after the zebra crossing, there are a pair of lane lines turning right that end at a slanting stop line.
                    The intent is that a right turning driver would stop before the zebra crossing on a red signal, but as the signal turns green, they can proceed to the next line where they can more clearly see oncoming
                    traffic and the road they seek to go to.

                    When I first left Japan, my parents had a book titled "you know you've been in Japan too long when..." and then
                    it had various (外人向け) jokes on things you get used to in Japan that don't really exist elsewhere. One of the
                    ones that confused me was about parks: there was a picture of a park bench and a tree and the caption was along the
                    likes of "... you think this is a park." I didn't understand it then and I don't fully understand it now.

                <div class="padded-text">
                    May be the joke is jealous of the fact that you can get whisked away into quiet, serene spaces next to the loud bustle
                    of the city. You do find the one-lot shrines almost everywhere and they somehow still create a vibe. The non-shrine
                    park-like spaces are also nice. Perhaps the right word for these spaces is more like "square" -- like the few benches
                    at Madison Square. Yes, the Japanese counterparts are still smaller, but they're also more frequent.

                    Some of these parks are actually more like New York's high-line: they reuse old rail rights of way to make pedestrian paradises.

                    The other tendency might just be a coincidence of where in Tokyo I am: since I'm in the reclaimed side, I see a lot of

                    features: willow trees, lotuses (depending on the purpose of the water), or flower beds. To continue comparing this with New York:
                    imagine some water feature in the middle of the high-line.

                    There are two popular catch phrases in urban planning: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=15+minute+city" alt="A concept so tragically steeped in controversy that I'm linking a search instead of a specific video.">the 15 minute city</a> -- the idea that you can reach most of your daily needs

                    people will naturally tend to exercise.

                    I think the things I'd like to disentangle are: rising rent costs, the displacement of communities, and the soullessness of newer
                    buildings.

                <div class="big-title">Rents</div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    I pay what I used to pay for rent in Pittsburgh within five kilometers of Tokyo station. Rent is not a huge issue in Japan.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    It <i>is</i> higher in Tokyo and that <i>is</i> high relative to the average Japanese income, but it's not as obscene as New York
                    or San Francisco.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    The reason for this is apparently simply that Japan incentivizes building much more than other countries tend to, so the market tends
                    to favor tentants instead of landlords.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    So, simply, the issue of spiralling rents is not the same in Japan as it is in the US and the UK.

                    The most compelling critique of gentrification is that it comes at the expense of the community that was already there.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Toyosu is probably not a good example of that since it was built for gas works and then slowly built up a community that is still
                    there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vsWJsiJzLdI?si=tSfbKb4Rowp4jNg-">History lesson if you're interested.</a> However, Tsukishima is
                    an example.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Tsukishima has a long history, starting as a fishing island in the early 1600s before eventually growing to the island it is.
                    The Tsukuda tower mansions came in in the 80s and completed the very different aesthetic.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    There is some argument that the local businesses are being displaced. However, this displacement isn't quite the lack of opportunity
                    that similarly displaced people in the US experience: it seems more like the displaced here do move upwards economically.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    To me, it seems like gentrification in Japan isn't pure economic cruelty: it is just cultural change.

                <div class="big-title">Soullessness</div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    The average tower mansion or danchi has no soul. Especially compared to older buildings.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    But caring about this is, I think, a Western set of values. Furthermore, with the fire hazards and earthquake risks, we can see
                    that property actually depreciates over time here. Therefore, developers cannot really value aesthetics -- they end up valuing
                    efficiency instead.

                <div class="padded-text">
                    Simply, things are very different in Japan, but you can smell gentrification.

                    The accessibilty of stations and public transit is not perfect. There are some stations with few elevators -- particularly relative to the number
                    of exits. Futhermore, many underground paths are randomly interrupted by stairs, sometimes with escalators.

                    Nagoya has a reputation of being a car-dependent city. It <i>is</i> near the Toyota plants, so there are people
                    with the Cadillac or Flint style attachment to car manufacturing.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Nagoya is also known for having a sparse metro network. And the neighborhoods covered by the metro are, like streetcar
                    subards, the oases of walkable areas. Areas far from the metro are either imporverished or car-dependent.

                    商店街 are the best. Almost always pedestrianized shopping streets with the best local stores. Furthermore, almost all these streets have
                    character -- small local shops you would never see elsewhere and nice vibes that only flourish in local streets made for thriving communities.

                    There are a few of these in Tokyo. Kagurazaka is like that towards the end (futher away from Idabashi), Monzennakacho has similar vibes, Sugamo
                    has a really nice street by the station, and Sunamachi Ginza is a really nice bit of town to walk through.
