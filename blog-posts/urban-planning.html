            <div class="padded-text">
                東京へ転職できました！And living my dream has taught me some stuff, and hopefully, will continue to teach me.
                One thing I started to get into was urban planning. Leaving the US is generally a breath of fresh air in terms
                of understanding what urban planning could be. And 2023 has had a lot of that, given that the latter half will
                be in Tokyo. So here I want to summarize some thoughts: not all "things the US does poorly," too -- there's
                definitely some "huh, I think the US does this better?" (Or, "woah, Tokyo does this weirdly.")
            </div>
            <div class="padded-text">
                Each observation will be followed by some opinions, so here's a list of them all so you can skip to things you're
                interested in:

                    <li>Malls are good actually?</li>
                </ol>
                It's vaguely ordered by: walking, taking the train, the roads, then the built environment. But some topics overlap.

            <div class="big-title">Bikes are just slightly better cars</div>

                This actually began to form in my head in India. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaveri_Bazaar">Zaveri Bazaar</a>,
                we had to weave around four layers of parked motorbikes to get from the narrow street to the storefront.
            </div>
            <div class="padded-text">
                Cementing this in further, was the fact that the one bike lane by the Google office in Pittsburgh had a signal for a pedestrian
                crossing.
            </div>
            <div class="padded-text">
                Finally, I biked in Tokyo. I used <a href="https://docomo-cycle.jp/">自転車シェアリング</a> to grab a bike from Tsukishima down
                to Tatsumi, for a 165 yen, 22 min ride.
            </div>
            <div class="padded-text">
                On the shared bike, I realized that I was pretty much functioning how I do when driving. The way I look at things, try to predict
                distant people's movements.
            </div>
            <div class="padded-text">
                And then I had to park it at Tatsumi station, with 100 other shared bikes.
            </div>
            <div class="padded-text">
                Tokyo, I think, is close to doing bikes right.
            </div>
            <div class="padded-text">
                Well, it's not perfect, but I actually think Amsterdam is too much, and the US is too little. Tokyo has wide enough side walks and
                safe side-streets, and this is a much more useful goal I think than simply trying to emulate the Netherlands.
            </div>
            <div class="padded-text">
                Not to mention: bikes are better than cars, but they're still mostly individual transit and don't scale the way public transit does.
                They still need parking -- you're likely going to see a high percent of time where the bike is parked, much like you can with cars.
                Futhermore, bikes are also dangerous. Yes, worst case fractures are significantly better than worst case dying, but it's still not as
                good as walking.
            </div>
            <div class="padded-text">
                In Japan, it seems that you can buy bike insurance, much like you buy car insurance. Additionally, Japan discourages bike and car
                commuting, perferring public transit (I'm not a legal expert -- I've just heard that there are some rules here that can be complicated).
            </div>
            <div class="padded-text">
                My perspective might be biased since a lot of urban planning YouTube does rant about bike infrastructure. This makes sense if the creator
                or intended audience are primarily in North America, as I think bike infrastructure will be a significant improvement there, but in Europe and
                Asia, I wonder if attention is best paid elsewhere.
            </div>
            <div class="big-title">Alarm fatigue: or the number of times one can hear ご注意してください and actually 注意して.</div>
            <div class="padded-text">
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_(Huxley_novel)">Aldous Huxley's "Island"</a>, the Myna birds are trained to say "Attention,"
                to foster attentiveness and awareness of the present.
            </div>
            <div class="padded-text">
                In Tokyo, every driveway and truck, most escalators, and some cross roads also have voices asking to ご注意ください.
            </div>
            <div class="padded-text">
                While to some I'm sure there's an element of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alarm_fatigue">alarm fatigue</a>, I think this has
                some urban planning benefits. For one, if you know when to expect the alarm, it's not tiring at all: it's actually somewhat pleasant to
                hear the thing you expect to. Additionally, and more importantly, I think this shows how much concern for safety is actually there.
            </div>
            <div class="padded-text">
                The nicest example of this is probably the people working at certain crossings -- parking lot entryways, or for school children. We should
                have more of these everywhere. I particularly like that driveways for supermarket parking lots have these.
