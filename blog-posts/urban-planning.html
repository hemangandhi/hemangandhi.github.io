                    東京へ転職できました！And living my dream has taught me some stuff, and hopefully, will continue to teach me.
                    One thing I started to get into was urban planning. Leaving the US is generally a breath of fresh air in terms
                    of understanding what urban planning could be. And 2023 has had a lot of that, given that the latter half will
                    be in Tokyo. So here I want to summarize some thoughts: not all "things the US does poorly," too -- there's
                    definitely some "huh, I think the US does this better?" (Or, "woah, Tokyo does this weirdly.")

                    It's vaguely ordered by: walking, taking the train, the roads, then the built environment. But some topics overlap.

                <div class="big-title">Bikes are just slightly better cars</div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    This actually began to form in my head in India. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaveri_Bazaar">Zaveri Bazaar</a>,
                    we had to weave around four layers of parked motorbikes to get from the narrow street to the storefront.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Cementing this in further, was the fact that the one bike lane by the Google office in Pittsburgh had a signal for a pedestrian
                    crossing.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Finally, I biked in Tokyo. I used <a href="https://docomo-cycle.jp/">自転車シェアリング</a> to grab a bike from Tsukishima down
                    to Tatsumi, for a 165 yen, 22 min ride.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    On the shared bike, I realized that I was pretty much functioning how I do when driving. The way I look at things, try to predict
                    distant people's movements.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    And then I had to park it at Tatsumi station, with 100 other shared bikes.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Tokyo, I think, is close to doing bikes right.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Well, it's not perfect, but I actually think Amsterdam is too much, and the US is too little. Tokyo has wide enough side walks and
                    safe side-streets, and this is a much more useful goal I think than simply trying to emulate the Netherlands.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Not to mention: bikes are better than cars, but they're still mostly individual transit and don't scale the way public transit does.
                    They still need parking -- you're likely going to see a high percent of time where the bike is parked, much like you can with cars.
                    Futhermore, bikes are also dangerous. Yes, worst case fractures are significantly better than worst case dying, but it's still not as
                    good as walking.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    In Japan, it seems that you can buy bike insurance, much like you buy car insurance. Additionally, Japan discourages bike and car
                    commuting, preferring public transit (I'm not a legal expert -- I've just heard that there are some rules here that can be complicated).
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    My perspective might be biased since a lot of urban planning YouTube does rant about bike infrastructure. This makes sense if the creator
                    or intended audience are primarily in North America, as I think bike infrastructure will be a significant improvement there, but in Europe and
                    Asia, I wonder if attention is best paid elsewhere.

                <div class="big-title">Alarm fatigue: or the number of times one can hear ご注意してください and actually 注意して.</div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_(Huxley_novel)">Aldous Huxley's "Island"</a>, the Myna birds are trained to say "Attention,"
                    to foster attentiveness and awareness of the present.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    In Tokyo, every driveway and truck, most escalators, and some cross roads also have voices asking to ご注意ください.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    While to some I'm sure there's an element of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alarm_fatigue">alarm fatigue</a>, I think this has
                    some urban planning benefits. For one, if you know when to expect the alarm, it's not tiring at all: it's actually somewhat pleasant to
                    hear the thing you expect to. Additionally, and more importantly, I think this shows how much concern for safety is actually there.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    The nicest example of this is probably the people working at certain crossings -- parking lot entryways, or for school children. We should
                    have more of these everywhere. I particularly like that driveways for supermarket parking lots have these.

                <div class="padded-text">
                    In the US you walk on the right. Similarly in the UK, you walk on the left. I think the only counter-examples I know are when there's just
                    a mass of people going the same way. So you'd think that Japan would be nice and orderly and you'd walk on the left everywhere. でじょう？
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Nope.

                <div class="padded-text">
                    What you actually need to do is read the signs. If there aren't signs? Read the air.

                <div class="padded-text">
                    While I don't expect this to actually be fixed on the average sidewalk, I always wonder what the logic is when this happens within a station.
                    (I think 銀座一丁目駅 insists that you stay on the left on after the ticket barrier but exit 8 wants you on the right and I'm decently sure
                    豊洲 is also inconsistent.)

            <div id="slide-4">
                <div class="big-title">Jay-walking. 横断禁止?</div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Japan is very anti-jaywalking. You have fences blocking you next to most of the (st)roads, and even some of the streets.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    However, there are two points that stick out to me: firstly, the narrower streets don't even have sidewalks, and secondly, despite the
                    fences, you can heard annoucements reminding you not to jaywalk.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Usually, I'm actually pro-jaywalking (or, I guess, against the <a href="https://youtu.be/lrfsTNNCbP0?si=GdZWEzVPcZcolIF0">term coined by car-companies</a>).
                    But I feel like Japan has a mix of good and bad. The fences add safety. The curbs and aforementioned crossing guards make cars feel like guests on side-walk
                    cutting driveways. The distances between crossings aren't bad.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Just: why do I have to either detour, go upwards, or remeber to
                    <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/hoEAS5Mt6TNQyFS87">cross 250m earlier</a> if I want to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/tNRP3nP7smZSsSjw8">cross to get to Aeon in Shinonome from Toyosu</a>?
                    Sometimes the infrastructure misses a point.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Not to mention that <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/KpAF9ojwiQFFhDFP8">this intersection in Shiohama</a> is very awkward at best: from the north-west, going clockwise, we have: just stairs
                    (north west corner), a long ramp for a bikes and pedestrians, a stair case with a ramp for bikers to push their bike up, and another elongated bike and pedestrian ramp. It's really weird that
                    the north-west corner is completely lacking in bike support. Also, there's no real reason you'd want to cross Mitsume dori as the elongated ramps insist you might: I think there might be just
                    as many trips where you'd have to cross mitsume dori again. Not to mention that if you just want to cross <span title="'Third ring road?' Not sure what that name is.">環状３号線</span> you might
                    be better of biking down the block, using the zebra crossing, and biking back up. It's a 100m detour and you don't have the cardio of climbing a ramp or carrying your bike up or down some stairs.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    So yeah, some good ideas with Jaywalking: the fences are safe, and I think the principles are sound. But some places just... drop the ball.

                <div class="big-title">Should maps be oriented for the viewer?</div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    This is really minor but something that boggled my mind the first time I realized it the maps in Tokyo are oriented for the viewer, not based on the compass.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    IDK. I guess that's all I had to say. I'm fascinated that this was even a point worth noticing, and it's a good reflection on familiarity and hidden assumptions. Also, the maps here are otherwise
                    brillaint. I also like the half-table half-map diagrams places have that explain how you should get there

                <div class="big-title">Massive stations for fun and profit!</div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Japanese stations can be massive and absurdly well-connected. (May be there is <a href="https://youtu.be/EhV500dnQ00?si=29DBYMOhadN5CQBD" alt="Or well, fun economics and history.">a profit incentive</a>.)
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    Of course, there are the famous stations: Shinjuku has probably the same throughput as various other metro systems, Tokyo station is better described as a mall (and a conglomerate of at least five stations, really),
                    and those are just the two biggest ones.
                </div>
                <div class="padded-text">
                    But the more fascinating point is not the massive "hauptbanhopf" or whatever -- a lot of places have really good massive main stations.
                    The more interesting stations are the medium sized stations: for example, 豊洲 station has some really neat connections: it reaches
                    from Lalaport through to the mall at Ciel Toyosu. It's really nice. And there's similar connectivity underground -- if not slightly more.
                    月島 is similarly nicely medium-sized, as is 住吉. It's convenient. And it's really nice that buildings have many ways to be reached.
                    It's also really fun for exploring and getting places.

                <div class="padded-text">
                    But you also get lost.

                <div class="padded-text">
                    市ヶ谷 has sent me for a loop -- it has a transfer-only exit that I only understood after... exiting. (You exit the metro and enter JR.)
                    That was frustrating. 飯田橋 is also kind of a maze. 日本橋 also has a confusing staircase that runs past a 銀座線 platform. But the
                    worst is probably 永田町 or 赤坂見附駅 -- here's <a href="https://youtu.be/_yfRF4Fc-l4?si=UL2QPWdAsN-M7_ty">a whole video about it</a>.
                    Seriously. That thing on the 半蔵門線 is the wrong kind of cross-platform transfer (though the one at 赤坂見附 is good).
