OK, never again.

But read further at your own risk of spoilers.

Also, not sure if the locale setting is the best. Just wanted to be sure stuff would render correctly.

                ask her anything unrelated to math. As compensation, she hopes that Araragi would continue to love math.

                After a test, it is revealed that 20 or so students have the identical answers to some questions in math
                tests and that these answers are too perfect: identically matching the answer key. Furthermore, it was
                found that the people were in the same study session and had taken notes from the test itself. The class
                deduced that somebody must have given the study session the test, after stealing it from the teacher's
                office. Hence, under the stern class representative, Oikura Sodachi, an arduous investigation begins.
                Araragi, walking in late, gets pinned with the task of leading the investigation. The class descends into
                a rude hellscape of agrument and nobody is able to agree on blaming a person, until Sodachi herself is
                brought up. Eventually, nobody defents her, so she is pinned with the blame. She never sounds up to school

                about a classmate. He explains the feelings in great depth, getting vague definitions of the shades of
                love from his younger sister. In this discussion, they conclude that Koyomi is just sexually frustrated and
                should revert to porn magazines. He asks Karen for a second opinion and she literally says "you know you're
                in love when you want their babies," ignoring all the shades Tsukihi discussed. In biking, Koyomi encounters
                Hanekawa with a bandage on her left cheek. She tells Araragi that her father hit her and makes him promise
                not to tell anybody else. He spends an absurd amount of time considering his promise, deciding to heal her

                Hanekawa's wound they encountered a silver cat with no tail. Oshino believes that they encountered a
                meddlesome cat that would require investigation. Oshino decides to investigate the cat while Araragi is

                is usually a very weak abberation, but in this case, the cat is using Hanekawa's intellect, so is difficult
                to defeat. In fact, over the week or so, Oshino was bested 20 times. Oshino points out that the cat must
                be stopped to prevent a complete merger of the cat and Hanekawa's consciousness so that Hanekawa may be
                recovered.

                Kokorowatari, the blade that kills abberations without harming any possessed bodies. Araragi lures
                Hanekawa to Oshino's place by emailing her claiming to be attacked by a vampire.

                Araragi's body in half and gets cut by the sword he swallowed. However, Hanekawa does not let the cat go.
                Shinobu, instead, fixes Araragi's body and defeats the cat.

                The monkey's paw Kanbaru has was originally thought to fulfill wishes in strange ways.
                In particular, as a somewhat estranged fourth grader, she found herself wishing to win a race.
                She wished upon the paw and found that her four competitors were attacked by a raincoat wearing
                monster. She believed that the paw would do more harm, fulfilling wishes in unexpected ways, so she
                did not use it. She wanted to use it to help Senjyogahara, but found that the paw only grants
                negative wishes, so would not have helped the crab. After some time, finding Senjyogahara in a
                relationship, Kanbaru wishes to replace the boyfriend. Oshino concludes that the paw attached as the
                paw took some of Kanbaru's soul, growing into her arm. The second wish, Oshino understands, is to
                kill Araragi. A fair exchange, he then reasons, would be to cut of Kanbaru's arm to prevent Araragi's
                death. Araragi does not accept this. Instead, he decides to beat the demon to make its contract
                impossible. Araragi gets shredded and then Oshino helps by summoning Senjyogahara. Senjyogahara
                resolves the situation by offering an ultimatum: that she would kill whoever kills Araragi unless

                to destroy the world if Araragi doesn't find her. Hachikuji was, as a ghost, the person who pointed this

                In Sodachi's apartment, there is a brief altercation about Senjyogahara's punch, with Sodachi intending

                Araragi asks her if she was the girl who taught him math. Sodachi, held back by Hanekawa, verbally
                assults Araragi, saying that helping him was a mistake. Araragi, in turn, calls her out for projecting
                her issues onto him. Sodachi, in turn, blames her parents: an abuse father and a mother who turned into
                an invalid after a divorce. Sodachi explains that she lived off government support and her mother
                eventually disappeared, so Sodachi moved into an apartment with government support. Sodachi denies that
                her circumstances are a tragedy, but merely normal. Hanekawa, however, delves into the particulars about
                Sodachi's mother's disappearance. Sodachi deflects the questions, talking about her short stay at the
                Araragi household. She reveals that her time there was too happy as she came to understand her own state.
                Sodachi pleads Araragi to be the villain of her life so she has a reason to stay miserable. Araragi
                believes that Sodachi can be happy, but agrees to be her villain. Abruptly, Sodachi adds that government
                officials are coming to assess her situation, so they should leave. Hanekawa promises to visit her and
                Sodachi asks if the pair could look for her mother, offering to appologize to Senjyogahara in return.

                Outside the apartment, Ougi shows up to help out. She mocks Hanekawa and points out that she's the
                better companion. Eventually, Araragi begs Ougi for the solution, but Hanekawa protests, claiming that
                she will solve the mystery in the next ten seconds. To do so, Hanekawa washes the dye out of her hair
                and comes to a conclusion. Furthermore, Hanekawa realizes that they shouldn't tell Sodachi. The pair
                then take turn providing hints so that Araragi eventually understands the truth: that Sodachi had lived
                with her mother's corpse for two years. Araragi decides to tell this to Sodachi knowing that even if
                he's hated, she make still love herself.

                agrees, but knows that he'd use his powers the instant it'd save somebody he cares about. Kagenui and
                Araragi move on to discussing why she focusses on immortal abberations. Shinobu and Ononoki playfully
                fight in the snow. In the middle of this, Gaen calls Kagenui and tells them to check on the girls at
                Kanbaru's house.

                All but Kagenui rush to the Kanbaru house, finding all three girls missing. Instead of them, there are
                paper cranes. The bird, Ononoki points out, indicates that the culprit is after Tsukihi. They report back
                to Kagenui who reveals that the culprit must be Tadatsuru Teori. Tadatsuru is a specialist in killing
                immortal abberations, so is after Tsukihi. Furthermore, neither Shinobu nor Araragi can use their
                vampiric abilities to beat him. Araragi considers it a divine punishment, but Kagenui and Ononoki point
                out that Tadatsuru must have realized that Araragi would be weakened at this point. In fact, as an artist,
                Tadatsuru pursues his own path, ignoring Oshino's view, so Araragi and Shinobu would be Tadatsuru's true
                targets. They find that Tadatsuru is waiting in the Kitashirahebi shrine. Quickly, they jump over to the
                shrine while Kagenui decides to walk at her own pace. She tells Araragi not to wait.

                Ononoki and Araragi land at the base of the mountain. Surprisingly, they meet Ougi and discuss the
                situation briefly. They continue up the mountain without Ougi, discussing their plan. Araragi hopes to
                sneak up on him, but Ononoki doubts the plan, suggesting that Araragi may be able to simply convince
                Tadatsuru to let the three girls go. Ononoki also explains the situation with Tadatsuru: in their college
                days, Oshino, Kaiki, Kagenui, and Tadatsuru did a project to reanimate a corpse. Gaen guided them but then
                Kagenui and Tadatsuru fought over Ononoki and Ononoki chose Kagenui, leading to a falling out. She explains
                that if the situation is too dire, she will offer her allegience in return for the girls' safety. Araragi
                refuses to consider this, instead suggesting that she could escape with the hostages while he would act
                as a decoy. Ononoki points out that Araragi is helpless without her and suggests offering Shinobu. Araragi
                refuses to consider this too and Ononoki suggests that this is a sign of immaturity. She adds that she
                would be able to kill him if she could sneak up on him. Araragi does not like this alternative since it
                would reduce Ononoki's humanity.

            <div class="place-description tsuki-4">
                The pair reach the shrine and find Tadatsuru folding paper cranes into the offer box. He is doing this to
                keep time, Araragi deduces. As Araragi prepares to confront the man, Shinobu emerges from his shadow. She
                tells him that she does not care about his humanity and would turn him into a full vampire if she had to.
                Araragi moves on, confronting Tadatsuru. Tadatsuru reveals that he and Kagenui were cursed and unable to
                walk on the ground. Tadatsuru adds that though he seems to be the perfect person to face Araragi, it is
                too perfect to just be a coincidence.

            <div class="place-description tsuki-4">
                Meanwhile, Ononoki is searching for the girls. Araragi is angered by Tadatsuru's statements, but this is,
                Tadatsuru points out, the exact role he's been cast. Tadatsuru tells Araragi to find Oshino since Oshino
                would know how to fix this, but Tadatsuru does not know where Oshino is. Tadatsuru drops the final crane
                into the box, stating that he tires of the chatter and decides to fight Araragi. Then Tadatsuru talks to
                somebody else, off screen. Suddenly, he is killed by Ononoki. Ononoki states that her choice was not
                Araragi's fault. She chose to kill Tadatsuru since she is a monster. They find the girls in the offer box
                and return them to Kanbaru's house. Araragi realizes that the incident could have been manufactured to put
                a rift between him and Ononoki.

                Realizing it's Valentine's day, Araragi parts with Ononoki and goes to Senjyogahara's house. Senjyogahara
                surprises him with chocolates. Senjyogahara guesses that worrying about future would not help. Returning
                home, Araragi finds Ononoki who explains that Tsukihi too won her in the claw game. Kagenui and Gaen too
                realize that the last day's incident would create a rift between Araragi and Ononoki, so they decided that
                it would be best if Ononoki stayed with them a while.

                a younger classmate. Ougi tells her that some "devil" is trying to solve other people's problems.
                Kanbaru tries to find this person, with fears that it is her arm acting up, becoming the first person
                to physically meet this devil for its services. The demon, it turns out, was an old basketball rival,
                Rouka Numachi.

                her, but meets Kaiki. She tries to run away, but Kaiki chases her down, insisting on feeling her. At the
                restaurant, Kaiki feels her meat, explaining that he was tasked to protect her. He further explains that
                he liked Kanbaru's mother, who was then known as Gaen.

                Numachi recounts how she came to collect misery and eventually found a woman afflicted by a devil's leg.
                She tells Kaiki of this, expressing interest in the leg. The next day, she found that leg on her. In a
                similar way, she has been collecting parts of the devil.

                Hearing the tale makes Kanbaru conflicted so she goes on a run. In the middle of nowhere, she collapses in

                Kanbaru has the devil's head and baits Numachi with it, proposing that if, in a basketball game, Numachi
                wins, she gets the head, but if she looses, she has to give up on her mission. Furthermore, since Kanbaru
                was an offensive player which Numachi specialized in defense, the game is set up so that Kanbaru wins if
                she scores. In the game, Kanbaru quickly wins. Numachi fades away, revealing that she was just a spirit,
                who just wanted to play a final game against Kanbaru. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWSCEt8XwG8" alt="This is also some good dialogue, but such a meme match">Here's that match.</a>

                This is sort of a stretch beyond the first three. It's hard to classify the girls and that doesn't even
                cover them all. <span title="Nadeko is best girl: I've neven thought that middle school me would be summarized in an anime girl and would actually almost perfectly voice things I've averted my eyes from about myself.">They also change a lot, fitting somewhat different tropes throughout.</span>
                Sodachi doesn't really fit a trope I know, and Ougi is... well, Ougi. Kagenui is cool, but also hard to
                put into a trope. Same with Karen and Suruga. Both of them are not in tropes I recognize.
