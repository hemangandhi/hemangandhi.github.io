                    Araragi catches Senjyogahara as she slips on a banana peel. After school, Araragi tries to ask
                    Hanekawa about Senjyogahara, as they discuss their student council work. Hanekawa says that
                    Senjyogahara had to miss school due to an illness and has only returned for the current year.
                    Senjyogahara then threatens Araragi at staple-point (stable staple) to keep his silence.
                    Revealing his quick-healing, Araragi earns Senjyogahara's trust and brings her to Oshino.
                    Oshino points out that this isn't the first girl Araragi brought, but offers to help,
                    requesting that Senjyogahara showers before coming to her midnight purification ritual.
                    Gods are portrayed as careless, especially the crab that stole Senjyogahara's weight.
                    Senjyogahara offers to pay 10000 yen for Oshino's services.

                    After much fan service with Senjyogahara asking Araragi for clothing recommendations after showering,
                    we return to Oshino's abandoned school. There, Oshino questions Senjyogahara to summon the Crab,
                    おもいしかに. The questions reveal that Senjyogahara's mother joined a cult when Senjyogahara was
                    sick and as a part of cult customs, a cult elder was allowed to have his way with the, then eighth
                    grader Senjyogahara. She fights him off, but with no support from her mother. After this, she faces
                    the crab and regains her feelings (思い). Araragi gains some weight (重い).

                    Araragi meets Senjyogahara at a random playground, sulking away from an argument with Karen.
                    He only reveals his reason through a strained conversation where we also learn that Senjyogahara
                    is now a friend. Then Araragi ends up beating up Hachikuji because she tries to keep him away.

                    goes to talk to Oshino while Hachikuji and Araragi wait at the playground. Tsubasa shows up and
                    re-hashes some of the relationship topics Araragi and Senjyogahara talked about earlier. Oshino
                    calls and says that Senjyogahara knows what to do.

                    that gets its victims lost. Hachikuji can't help it, but is returned to her mother's home by
                    being lead through new roads she doesn't know as a ghost. At this point, Araragi makes a resolution:
                    in his relationship with Senjyogahara (which he just starts), neither will hide facts from the other.

                    Hachikuji, he also meets Suraga who seems to look up to him. At Senjyogahara's, after a brief chat
                    about their future, Araragi makes the mistake of bringing up Suraga. We learn that Suraga and
                    Senjyogahara were in the same middle school, where they were a famous duo. Then, on the way home,
                    Araragi tries to give Oshino Senjyogahara's payment, but is attacked by some hooded gorilla figure
                    on the way. Senjyogahara finds him on the some rail tracks and reminds him to pay Oshino.

                    Araragi goes to Suraga's house, finding her red book-filled room.
                    She immediately appologizes for attacking him, revealing that
                    her left arm is a monkey's paw. More to Araragi's surprise, she admits that she's lesbian. At
                    Oshino's, where Araragi takes her for help, the monkey's paw is accepted as a lesser demon that will
                    leave Suraga's arm after fulfilling 3 wishes.

                <div class="bake-8">
                    The monkey's paw Kanbaru has was originally thought to fulfill wishes in strange ways.
                    In particular, as a somewhat estranged fourth grader, she found herself wishing to win a race.
                    She wished upon the paw and found that her four competitors were attacked by a raincoat wearing
                    monster. She believed that the paw would do more harm, fulfilling wishes in unexpected ways, so she
                    did not use it. She wanted to use it to help Senjyogahara, but found that the paw only grants
                    negative wishes, so would not have helped the crab. After some time, finding Senjyogahara in a
                    relationship, Kanbaru wishes to replace the boyfriend. Oshino concludes that the paw attached as the
                    paw took some of Kanbaru's soul, growing into her arm. The second wish, Oshino understands, is to
                    kill Araragi. A fair exchange, he then reasons, would be to cut of Kanbaru's arm to prevent Araragi's
                    death. Araragi does not accept this. Instead, he decides to beat the demon to make its contract
                    impossible. Araragi gets shredded and then Oshino helps by summoning Senjyogahara. Senjyogahara
                    resolves the situation by offering an ultimatum: that she would kill whoever kills Araragi unless
                    she dies. This makes it impossible for the demon to grant Kanbaru's wish.

                    due to a headache. Araragi recognises the girl as Nadeko Sengoku, a childhood friend of his sisters'.
                    Araragi and Kanbaru intercept Sengoku at the shrine, taking her to the Araragi house. She takes of

                    Jyagirinawa. Sengoku was cursed after rejecting a boy that some classmate liked. The curse usually
                    would not take effect, being placed by an amateur, but Sengoku went to Kitashirahebi which is
                    under corrupted influences

                    Araragi obtains a charm to get rid of Jyagirinawa and they head to Kitashirahebi to remove it.
                    The ritual seems successful, but Sengoku is still in pain. It becomes clear that she's being attacked
                    by two snakes, the second one placed by the boy she rejected. Kanbaru and Araragi manage to
                    stave the second snake off, drawing it after themselves and tracing its imprints on the grass.
                    Araragi laments that he didn't destoy it since it would attack the boy who placed it.

                    bad influence Araragi is on Senjyogahara, but Hanekawa leaves with a headache. Araragi recalls
                    that similar events happened over golden week, when Hanekawa turned into a cat. Oshino explained
                    this was a manifestation of her stress and Shinobu resolved the situation by baiting the cat with

                    During these hours, Araragi is teased relentlessly: he is forced to call Hitagi by first name as
                    "Senjyogahara" is ambiguous (she pretends it's addressed to her father). She pressed him, asking
                    him what he likes about her (even answering him directly when he tried to reflect the question back).
                    Then they get to the park. Her father parks and they head out, to walk in the woods. Senjyogahara
                    blindfolds Araragi. In the middle of the forest, Senjyogahara lays out a blanket and removes the blindfolds.
                    They lie in an opening and look at the stars. She says that the stars, her wealth, and her intelligence
                    are everything she treasures and all that she'd be able to give him. Then, like a good tsundere, she

                    Araragi bumps into Hachikuji and teases her as usually (sorry I stuttered). Hachikuji breaks Araragi's
                    finger by mistake. Hachikuji tells Araragi that Shinobu was at a donut store. The plot thickens with
                    Hanekawa texting him, telling him to ditch school and come to a playground. At the playground, he
                    finds Hanekawa in her pyjamas and a hat. They talk about her headaches and Araragi persuades her to
                    take her hat off, revealing cat ears.  They go to Oshino who they find burying something in the dirt.
                    On the way, Hanekawa suggests that Araragi is surrounded by women, and that perhaps it's his
                    vampiric charm that draws all of them into him. Oshino knocks Hanekawa out, and her hair turns
                    white, revealing the cat.

                    Araragi decides to enlist Shinobu, but she's nowhere to be found. The cat wakes up and seems to help
                    Araragi. Yet, the cat cannot sniff out Shinobu. In talking, however, the cat points out that the
                    cause of Hanekawa's stress was her unrequited love for Araragi.

                    Araragi is confused after hearing that Hanekawa had feelings for him. He argues with the cat, saying
                    that the feelings were a mistake. The cat points out that killing Araragi would be another solution.
                    However, recalling Senjyogahara's words, Araragi decides that he does not want to die. In desparation,
                    he asks for help from Shinobu who appears out of his shadow. It is revealed that the cat was trying
                    to corner Araragi where he wouldn't have a shadow for Shinobu to hide in, but now that she's out,
                    she sucks that cat's strength away. Hanekawa reconciles her feelings,<span class="second-5">a little,</span>
                    sorry that the cat had had to do her dirty work.
