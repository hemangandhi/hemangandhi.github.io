                    Hanekawa about Senjyogahara, as they discuss their student council work. Hanekawa says that
                    Senjyogahara had to miss school due to an illness and has only returned for the current year.
                    Senjyogahara then threatens Araragi at staple-point (stable staple) to keep his silence.
                    Revealing his quick-healing, Araragi earns Senjyogahara's trust and brings her to Oshino.
                    Oshino points out that this isn't the first girl Araragi brought, but offers to help,
                    requesting that Senjyogahara showers before coming to her midnight purification ritual.
                    Gods are portrayed as careless, especially the crab that stole Senjyogahara's weight.

                    sick and as a part of cult customs, a cult elder was allowed to have his way with the, then eighth
                    grader Senjyogahara. She fights him off, but with no support from her mother. After this, she faces
                    the crab and regains her feelings (思い). Araragi gains some weight (重い).

                re-hashes some of the relationship topics Araragi and Senjyogahara talked about earlier. Oshino

                being lead through new roads she doesn't know as a ghost. At this point, Araragi makes a resolution:
                in his relationship with Senjyogahara (which he just starts), neither will hide facts from the other.

                about their future, Araragi makes the mistake of bringing up Suraga. We learn that Suraga and
                Senjyogahara were in the same middle school, where they were a famous duo. Then, on the way home,
                Araragi tries to give Oshino Senjyogahara's payment, but is attacked by some hooded gorilla figure

                Araragi goes to Suraga's house, finding her red book-filled room.
                She immediately appologizes for attacking him, revealing that
                her left arm is a monkey's paw. More to Araragi's surprise, she admits that she's lesbian. At
                Oshino's, where Araragi takes her for help, the monkey's paw is accepted as a lesser demon that will
                leave Suraga's arm after fulfilling 3 wishes.

            <div class="place-description bake-8">
                The monkey's paw Kanbaru has was originally thought to fulfill wishes in strange ways.
                In particular, as a somewhat estranged fourth grader, she found herself wishing to win a race.
                She wished upon the paw and found that her four competitors were attacked by a raincoat wearing
                monster. She believed that the paw would do more harm, fulfilling wishes in unexpected ways, so she
                did not use it. She wanted to use it to help Senjyogahara, but found that the paw only grants
                negative wishes, so would not have helped the crab. After some time, finding Senjyogahara in a
                relationship, Kanbaru wishes to replace the boyfriend. Oshino concludes that the paw attached as the
                paw took some of Kanbaru's soul, growing into her arm. The second wish, Oshino understands, is to
                kill Araragi. A fair exchange, he then reasons, would be to cut of Kanbaru's arm to prevent Araragi's
                death. Araragi does not accept this. Instead, he decides to beat the demon to make its contract
                impossible. Araragi gets shredded and then Oshino helps by summoning Senjyogahara. Senjyogahara
                resolves the situation by offering an ultimatum: that she would kill whoever kills Araragi unless
                she dies. This makes it impossible for the demon to grant Kanbaru's wish.

                due to a headache. Araragi recognises the girl as Nadeko Sengoku, a childhood friend of his sisters'.
                Araragi and Kanbaru intercept Sengoku at the shrine, taking her to the Araragi house. She takes of

                Jyagirinawa. Sengoku was cursed after rejecting a boy that some classmate liked. The curse usually
                would not take effect, being placed by an amateur, but Sengoku went to Kitashirahebi which is
                under corrupted influences

                Araragi obtains a charm to get rid of Jyagirinawa and they head to Kitashirahebi to remove it.
                The ritual seems successful, but Sengoku is still in pain. It becomes clear that she's being attacked
                by two snakes, the second one placed by the boy she rejected. Kanbaru and Araragi manage to
                stave the second snake off, drawing it after themselves and tracing its imprints on the grass.
                Araragi laments that he didn't destoy it since it would attack the boy who placed it.

                bad influence Araragi is on Senjyogahara, but Hanekawa leaves with a headache. Araragi recalls
                that similar events happened over golden week, when Hanekawa turned into a cat. Oshino explained
                this was a manifestation of her stress and Shinobu resolved the situation by baiting the cat with

                which Senjyogahara doesn't mind. Mr Senjyogahara, Hitagi's dad, drives the couple for a few hours.
                During these hours, Araragi is teased relentlessly: he is forced to call Hitagi by first name as
                "Senjyogahara" is ambiguous (she pretends it's addressed to her father). She pressed him, asking
                him what he likes about her (even answering him directly when he tried to reflect the question back).
                Then they get to the park. Her father parks and they head out, to walk in the woods. Senjyogahara forces
                Araragi to look down. In the middle of the forest, Senjyogahara lays out a blanket and has him lies
                down with eyes closed. She lies next to him, letting him open his eyes.
                They lie in an opening and look at the stars. She says that the stars, her friends, and her intelligence

                Hanekawa texting him, telling him to ditch school and come to a playground. At the playground, he
                finds Hanekawa in her pyjamas and a hat. They talk about her headaches and Araragi persuades her to
                take her hat off, revealing cat ears.  They go to Oshino who they find burying something in the dirt.
                On the way, Hanekawa suggests that Araragi is surrounded by women, and that perhaps it's his
                vampiric charm that draws all of them into him. Oshino knocks Hanekawa out, and her hair turns

                Tsuhiki tells him "千石また恋している". In Araragi's eyes, for a few seconds, we see "来い".
                Tsuhiki's line means "Sengoku still likes you" with "koi" as the word for liking. In his eyes,
                we see "koi" interpreted as "to invite," highlighting that he thinks Sengoku is merely inviting him,
                and is blind to her true feelings. On the way, he stumbles into Hachikuji and they talk for
                a long time. She says she'll be sure to tell him when she goes, similar to Oshino.

                form there. She and learns that the link between Shinobu and Koyomi has been weakened,
                so Shinobu has been looking for him. The cat says that Araragi should be at the cram school and offers
                to give Shinobu a ride there. They reach finding the school burnt down.

                meets the Araragi mother who cautions her against considering herself an Araragi. The mother also says
                that averting one's eyes from the problem is not going to solve it, in reference to Hanekawa's situation
                with her parents.

            <div class="place-description second-4">
                While walking through a park, Hanekawa bumps into Episode. They talk about their past encounter. Additionally,
                they meet Izuko Gaen, Oshino's senpai. Gaen proclains that she knows everything, even Hanekawa's feelings
                for Araragi and the fact that Hanekawa is trying to research Kako, the tiger. Gaen points out that the
                problem is Hanekawa's and Hanekawa's only. Hanekawa cannot find anything about this Kako and Senjyogahara
                fears that "Kako" is a name Gaen invented. Senjyogahara points out that Gaen is related to Kanbaru -- Gaen
                was Kanbaru's mother's maiden name. Furthermore, Senjyogahara states that there is a pattern in the
                burnings: all the places that Hanekawa slept burn down. This would include Senjyogahara's house and then
                the Araragi household. On returning to the Araragi household, the sisters force her to play cards as they
                discuss the interpretations of fire -- including jealously. As she prepares to confront the tiger, she
                takes a picture of herself in Koyomi's room, sending it to somebody on her phone. She then writes a note
                to her cat-form.

            <div class="place-description second-5">
                In the letter, Hanekawa tells the cat that the tiger is, like the cat, an abberation borne of her feelings,
                this one being burning jealousy. Hanekawa asks both spirits to return to her heart, where she can face her
                feelings instead of averting her eyes. As the tiger comes to burn, Senjyogahara's house, the cat tries
                and fails to stop him. This delays the tiger just enough for Araragi to come and rescue Hanekawa. After
                her rescue, Hanekawa confesses to Araragi directly and cries about her rejection. Later on, we find that
                she has stripes in her hair from absorbing the tiger. In the new rental property, she requests her
                parents her own room, remarking "ただ今".

                a lot of money and Senjyogahara pays up, thinking about how this would avoid getting on Kanbaru's bad side,
