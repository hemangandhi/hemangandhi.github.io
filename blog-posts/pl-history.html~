          <div class="big-title">What?</div>
          <div class="padded-text">This is a story about taste, really. It's not about C++ until the ending. This is introspection about how I developed an opinion on programming languages. It's motivated by a realization: I enjoy watching CPPCon talks but used to think I hated C++.</div>

          <div class="big-title">The Origin Story</div>
          <div class="padded-text">I was lucky with coding: since my parents work in IT, when I expressed an interest in MS LOGO and flowcharts as a fifth grader, they were quick to get me to learn Scratch, and even today, understand a lot about what I do.</div>
          <div class="padded-text">I moved to the US in high school and coming from England meant that I had no clue how grades worked. In England, you can just track yourself along national curricular levels and I was content with my standing. American grades, with percentage breakdowns and the GPA made no sense. This motivated me to try to make an app (that I haven't made still). So I learned Java, because I had an Android.</div>
          <div class="padded-text"> Then my dad found <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">codecademy.com</a> and that opened Pandora's box. I learned JS, then PHP, then Python, then Ruby. I didn't really build too much in these languages yet, but I loved absorbing new syntax and learning random tricks and tools.</div>
