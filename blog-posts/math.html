            <div class="padded-text">This is a philosophy rant being typed up by a programmer who did too much math. Please remember that. I think it's important to know that I know nothing. But what I'm hoping to go on about is just math. Bringing religion into the discussion is for the smilie I'm making - so it's there, and I have hardly even done that. But the key point is that math is everything I hoped a religion would be - at least, when it's properly done. And sometimes, mathematics (and the rest of science) and religion have similar pitfalls, I think.</div>
            <div class="padded-text">So first, I suppose I ought to define religion: at least, my ideal one. I think a religion has two properties: beliefs that are unique to it (axioms, if you will), and a system of bringing people together. In order to make the religion ideal, I dream of seeing that the system of bringing people together does not limit the questioning of the axioms and the axioms do not exclude people. I call what most people call religions (Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, and the like) "canonical religions."</div>
            <div class="padded-text">Now that I have a definition, I shall provide examples. Eventually, I may conclude with something resembling a theorem.</div>

                This whole post comes from this moment. I was running late to a RUMA lecture and found myself on its outskirts. The lecture was about large cardinals and the professor lecturing was starting sentences with "if you believe in." This was odd to me on two levels: firstly, what is "belief," and more importantly, why did this phrase seem so natural?
                Initially, I was glad: I had so many compliments to bestow upon mathematics - my then love. It seemed clear that mathematics was the unique place where people could just switch axioms about the universe on or off and have a civil, rational discourse about the matter.
                There was an ultra-finitist in the department, a colleague of the professor talking about infinite infinities. I doubt religions (the canonical ones) could be more different.
                But they would be civil. They know that neither of them is necessarily more correct than the other. At the very least, they do not start wars with each other.
                Furthermore, the professor talking about large cardinals did not know only one branch of the theory: he knew a few variants.
            </div>
            <div class="padded-text">
                It occured to me, as I saw the professor traversing the decision tree on some sets of axioms, that this happens all over the place: there are various proofs that assume the Riemann hypothesis and various that assume its opposite. The same holds for P = NP.
                In fact, there is an axiom that mathematicians turn on or off and have two versions of math for this decision. This is the axiom of choice.
                What it says is that from an infinite set of infinite sets, you can pick one thing from each set. For instance, if you have an infinite wardobe, you can pick an item from each (infinite) drawer.
                Choice lets you make algebra a bit nicer. Linear algebra has bases in fully generality and various other ring theorems lose their Noetherian hypothesis.
                But there be dragons: oddities like the Banach-Tarski paradox (a cutting of one ball into two balls with the same volume as the original) arise.
                Yet mathematicians are happy to keep the dichotomy: they simply note the controversial axiom as an extra hypothesis.
            </div>
            <div class="padded-text">
                Hence, in many fundamental ways (by example, at least), mathematics is an ideal religion: axioms don't exclude and people can always question them.
            </div>

            <div class="padded-text">
                It would be unfair to say that canonical religions haven't enjoyed some idealness properties too. The ancedotes get a little sparse here since whatever part religion played in my life didn't tend to let itself be fully questioned.
                But there are one or two ancedotes that are worth sharing.
            </div>
            <div class="padded-text">
                Firstly, it should be clear that my definition of a religion does not preclude any canonical one: all the normal religions are sets of axioms and a way to bring people together.
