                Built a Python Flask app that hoped to send snippets of songs via
                Facebook messenger (instead of GiFS) so that song lyrics could be
                added to group chats. Got song lyric-based search working but
                could not find the correct snippet of the song.

                In a team of two, created a python tool with pyaudio and scipy to
                recognize audio input to simulate a keyboard and produce sound
